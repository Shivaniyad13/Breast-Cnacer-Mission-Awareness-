  {
    q: "What is breast cancer?",
    a: "Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. It usually starts in the lobules (the glands that produce milk) or the ducts (the passages that carry milk from the glands to the nipple). These mutated cells can form a tumor that can often be seen on an X-ray or felt as a lump. If left untreated, cancerous cells can invade surrounding healthy tissue or spread to other parts of the body (metastasis)."
  },
  {
    q: "Can breast cancer be prevented?",
    a: "While breast cancer cannot be completely prevented, you can significantly reduce your risk by adopting a healthy lifestyle. This includes maintaining a healthy weight, staying physically active, limiting alcohol intake, avoiding smoking, and breastfeeding if possible. Regular clinical screenings and monthly self-examinations are vital, as detecting cancer at Stage I yields a survival rate of over 98%."
  },
  {
    q: "Who is at higher risk?",
    a: "Risk factors include being female, aging (particularly over 40), personal or family history of breast cancer, dense breast tissue, genetic mutations (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes), early onset of menstruation (before age 12), late menopause, and lifestyle factors. Having risk factors does not mean you will get cancer, but it increases the importance of early and regular screenings."
  },
  {
    q: "How often should screening be done?",
    a: "It is recommended that women over 20 perform a Breast Self-Examination (BSE) monthly. A Clinical Breast Examination (CBE) should be performed by a healthcare professional every 1 to 3 years for women aged 20-39, and annually for women 40 and older. Mammography screening is recommended annually or biennially for women starting at age 40, or earlier if they have high-risk factors."

                  Breast cancer is a clinical disease in which normal cells in the breast mutate and divide in an uncontrolled, rapid fashion. This aberrant growth forms a dense mass of cells known as a <strong>tumor</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>How it develops:</strong> The breast is composed of three main parts: lobules (glands that produce milk), ducts (tubes that carry milk to the nipple), and connective tissue. Most breast cancers begin in the ducts (ductal carcinoma) or the lobules (lobular carcinoma). The cancer can spread outside the breast through blood vessels and lymph channels, a process known as metastasis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Importance of Awareness:</strong> Breast cancer is highly treatable if detected in its localized, early stages (Stage I), showing a five-year survival rate of over <strong>98%</strong>. Being aware of how your breasts normally look and feel is essential for identifying warning signs early.
