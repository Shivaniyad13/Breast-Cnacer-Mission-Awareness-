  {
    question: "How do I choose the right breast cancer specialist?",
    answer: "A certified breast surgeon or surgical oncologist should be your first consult for a suspicious lump. When diagnosed, they will coordinate with a medical oncologist and a radiation oncologist. It is ideal to choose specialists who work within a multidisciplinary team or host tumor boards, ensuring all angles of your biology are discussed collectively."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I see a medical oncologist?",
    answer: "You should see a medical oncologist immediately after receiving a tissue biopsy report confirming cancer cells. They will assess hormone receptor parameters (ER, PR, HER2 status) and design any necessary systemic therapies, such as pre-surgery (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy to shrink tumors, or post-surgery (adjuvant) chemotherapy."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the role of a breast surgeon?",
    answer: "A breast surgeon specializes specifically in breast physiology, conservative breast surgeries (lumpectomies), and breast mastectomies. They remove cancer cell margins, evaluate lymph nodes, and coordinate closely with reconstructive surgeons for form restoration."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a second opinion?",
    answer: "Yes. Getting a second opinion is a standard and highly encouraged protocol in oncology. It ensures the staging is accurate and validates the proposed treatment plan. Any reputable specialist will gladly support you sharing your pathology slides and imaging records with another center."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I undergo screening?",
    answer: "For healthy women of average risk, standard guidelines recommend clinical examinations and mammograms annually starting at age 40. If you have a family history of breast cancer (BRCA gene mutations), screening should begin earlier (often at age 25 or 30) using alternate diagnostic methods like breast MRIs."
  },
  {
    question: "What support services are available?",
    answer: "Our network connects you with free patient navigation services, government funding subsidies, emotional counseling, home nursing support (port flushes), post-operative physiotherapy, and weekly survivor-led support groups to guide you through recovery."
